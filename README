ABOUT

This is a Grails app that allows you to send

It uses an HTTPS based messaging server that
sends out standard email notifications to 
recipients of new messages waiting within the
secure messaging system.

Database Server (MySQL, or any Hibernate comatable RDBMS)
Java Application Server (Tomcat 6 is preferred)
SMTP Mail server (postfix, sendmail, etc...)
Grails 1.3.7+ (to build)
